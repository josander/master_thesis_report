We would like to thank our supervisors at Recorded Future Staffan Truv√© and Michel Edkrantz, both for letting us do our master thesis at Recorded Future and for offering their time and professional insights whenever we needed it. We are also grateful towards the rest of the staff at Recorded Future and especially the security analysts that were willing to aid us with important cyber security questions.

We would also like to thank our academic supervisor and examiner Mats Granath at Chalmers.
